# DLA-Diffusion-limited-aggregation

This project is developed in the Applied Physics Laboratory at IFES-Cariacica where I am studying Physics

A Diffusion-limited aggregation is the process whereby particles undergoing a random walk due to Brownian motion cluster together to form aggregates of such particles

(ongoing project)
