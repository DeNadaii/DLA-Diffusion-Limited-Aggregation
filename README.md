# Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) Project

This is the README file for the Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) project. In this project, we are studying and implementing the DLA algorithm to simulate the growth of fractal patterns through particle aggregation.

# What is a DLA ?

Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) is the process whereby particles undergoing a random walk due to Brownian motion cluster together to form aggregates of such particles. This theory, proposed by T.A. Witten Jr. and L.M. Sander in 1981, is applicable to aggregation in any system where diffusion is the primary means of transport in the system. DLA can be observed in many systems such as electrodeposition, Hele-Shaw flow, mineral deposits, and dielectric breakdown.

## Project Description

The Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA) project focuses on exploring and analyzing the DLA algorithm, which is a computational model used to simulate the growth of fractal-like patterns. The algorithm starts with a seed particle, and additional particles are randomly released into the system. These particles undergo random walks, and upon contact with existing aggregates, they stick to them, gradually forming complex branching structures.

In this project, we aim to understand the underlying principles of DLA and its applications. We implement the algorithm using a programming language Python and utilize appropriate libraries or frameworks for simulations and visualization.
